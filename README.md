Have you ever struggle to find casual activities to do with your friends? University students struggle to reconnect with their friends due to lack of varieties of activity, and maybe you'll do one or two trip per year with them to reconnect and create meaningful memories. What if there is a way where everytime you visit your friends, you'll create memories that you'll cherish for a long time.

My design problem is how can I make it intuitive for students to spend meaningful time with their friends? Which I came up with a web-app that generate activites and challenges from a wide source of database for you and your friends to enjoy. This solves the issue of organising something memorable while still keeping it casual and fun. This is inspired by playground games that we use to play as kids and challenges you and friends partake in. The web-app allows users to browse through a whole variety of activities created by other users. You are also able to design your own activity and share it into the database for you and everyone else to enjoy. The downside to this is it does not provide any tools for the activities and only ideas and inspiration for the user. Future opportunities for this is to partner with other businesses to enhance the experience more for users.
